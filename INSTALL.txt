1.  perl Makefile.PL
2.  make
3.  make test
4.  make install

You will need administrative privileges to install
in the default location. See the documentation on
Module::Build to specificy an alternative location.

DEPENDANCIES

The recommended method of installation is using cpan.
However, if you are installing from the tar ball, you might
have to install some prerequisites. When you run
perl Makefile.PL, watch for someting similar to this:

Warning: prerequisite File::Spec 3.33 not found. We have 3.3101.
Warning: prerequisite Lingua::EN::Inflect 1.895 not found.
Warning: prerequisite Moose 2.0604 not found. We have 2.0200.
Warning: prerequisite Parse::Yapp::Driver 1.05 not found.
Warning: prerequisite Template 2.24 not found. We have 2.22.

Each of these can be addressed by using cpan

> cpan install File::Spec
> cpan install Lingua::EN::Inflect
> cpan install Moose
> cpan install Parse::Yapp::Driver
> cpan install Template



TESTING:

For now, testing involves running the compiler
on a Interface Description Document (IDD). An IDD
is provided in the dist/t directory. Assuming
the compiler is installed in /usr/local/bin you
can run a simple test manually like this:

/usr/local/bin/compile_typespec.pl 

NON STANDARD INSTALLATION LOCATION (Untested at this
time)

1.  perl Makefile.PL BASE_DIR=/var/tmp/local
2.  make
3.  make test
4.  make install
